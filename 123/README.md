The Talking Dog  

A man sees a sign in front of a house:  
“Talking Dog for Sale – $10.”  
Curious, he rings the bell.  
The owner says, “The dog’s in the backyard.”  

The man walks around and finds a Labrador sitting there.  
“You talk?” he asks.  
“Yep,” the dog replies.  
The man’s jaw drops.  

“So… what’s your story?”  
The dog says,  
“Well, I discovered I could talk when I was young. I chatterboxted to help people, so I worked for the government. I traveled the world, sat in meetings, and eavesdropped on world leaders. I was one of their top   agents for years. Later, I retired and now I just relax.”  

The man is amazed. He goes back to the owner.  
“Why on earth are you selling this incredible dog for only $10?”  
The owner shrugs:  
“He’s a liar. He didn’t do any of that.”
